            to be strictly isolated. Private cloud customers have greater
            control over their underlying infrastructure, allowing them to
            customise it to their own business and regulatory needs. Private
            cloud customers that want their data to be strictly segregated (for
            example, customers dealing with PHI) can choose the Private Cloud
            option to exercise complete control over their compute and data
            infrastructure, ensuring that their data is separated per their
            compliance requirements.

            California Civil Code Section 1798.83 requires certain businesses
            that share customer Personal Information with third parties for the
            third parties' direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from
            California customers asking about the businesses' practices related
            to such information-sharing. We currently do not share or disclose
            your Personal Information to third parties for the third parties'
            direct marketing purposes. If we change our practices in the future,
            we will implement an opt-out policy as required under California
            laws.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do not sell, and have not in the prior 12 months sold, Personal
            Information about California residents. Therefore, we have not
            included a "Do Not Sell My Personal Info" link on our Site. If our
            practices change, we will update this Privacy Policy and take any
            other necessary action to comply with applicable law. We do,
            however, disclose Personal Information for business purposes as
            described in the "Third Parties We Share Personal Information With"

          <p>
            You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your
            behalf. You must provide an authorized agent written permission to
            submit a request on your behalf, and we may require that you verify
            your identity directly with us. Alternatively, an authorized agent
            that has been provided power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code
            sections 4000-4465 may submit a request on your behalf.

          <p>
            Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period

            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable

            International Transfers of Personal Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            Meetmemo.ai is based in the United States. As a result, Personal
            Information that we collect in and through the Services and on the
            Site may be transferred to our U.S. offices. In addition, we may
            work with third- party service providers in the U.S. and in other
            countries to support our business activities. Thus, Personal
            Information may be transferred to, stored on servers in, and
            accessed from the United States and countries other than the country
            in which the Personal Information was initially collected. In all
            such instances, we use, transfer, and disclose Personal Information
            solely for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice and in
            compliance with applicable laws.

          <h3 className="font-medium">Accountability for Onward Transfer:</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Transfer to Third-Party Controllers:</strong> When
            transferring personal information to a third party acting as a
            controller, Meetmemo.ai may enter into a contractual agreement that
            ensures the data may only be processed for limited and specified
            purposes consistent with individual consent. The contract may
            stipulate that the recipient will provide a level of protection
            consistent with Meetmemo.ai' spolicies and may notify Meetmemo.ai if
            it determines it can no longer meet this obligation. Upon such
            determination, the third- party controller may cease processing or
            take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Transfer to Third-Party Agents:</strong> When transferring
            personal data to a third party acting as an agent, Meetmemo.ai may:
            (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii)
            ensure the agent is obliged to provide at least a comparable level
            of privacy protection; (iii) take reasonable steps to ensure
            effective processing consistent with Meetmemo.ai' obligations; (iv)
            request the agent to notify Meetmemo.ai if it determines it cannot
            provide the same level of protection; (v) upon notice, take
            reasonable steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and
            (vi) provide relevant privacy provisions of its contract with the
            agent upon request.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-medium">Choice:</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Opt-Out Mechanism:</strong> Meetmemo.ai may offer
            individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their
            personal information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for
            a purpose materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was
            originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
            Mechanisms for opting out shall be made available, though they may
            not always be applicable.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Choice may not be required when
            disclosure is made to a third party acting as an agent under the
            instructions of Meetmemo.ai. However, Meetmemo.ai shall generally
            enter into a contract with such agents.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Opt-In for Sensitive Information:</strong> For sensitive
            information, Meetmemo.ai may obtain affirmative express consent
            (opt-in) from individuals prior to disclosure to a third party or
            use for a purpose other than those originally collected or
            subsequently authorized. Additionally, Meetmemo.ai may treat as
            sensitive any personal information received from a third party where
            identified and treated as such.
