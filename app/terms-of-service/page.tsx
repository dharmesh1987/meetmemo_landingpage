          9. Links to Third-Party Websites
        </h2>
        <p>
          From time to time, the app may have links to sites outside of it.
          These sites may have links to offers and promotions from third
          parties. We put these in so that you can find information, products,
          or services that you might find helpful or interesting. We are not
          responsible for what is on these sites or what they offer, and we
          can't promise that they will always be up and running. Just because we
          have links to these other sites doesn't mean that we support or work
          with the people who run or promote them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The terms and conditions of use and privacy policies for any website
          controlled, owned, or run by a third party tell you how to use that
          website. You use these websites run by other people at your own risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meetmemo makes it clear that it is not responsible for anything that
          happens because you use or look at websites or other content linked
          from the Services. You agree to not hold Meetmemo responsible for
          anything that might happen if you click on a link on the Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          As part of the way the Services work, you can link your Account with
          online accounts you may have with third-party service providers like
          Google (each such account, a "Third-Party Account") by either: (i)
          providing your Third-Party Account login information through the
          Services; or (ii) allowing Meetmemo to access your Third-Party
          Account, as permitted by the terms and conditions that govern your use
          of each Third-Party Account. You promise that you have the right to
          give Meetmemo your Third-Party Account login information and/or give
          Meetmemo access to your Third-Party Account, without breaking any of
          the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable
          Third-Party Account and without requiring Meetmemo to pay any fees or
          making Meetmemo subject to any usage limits set by such third-party
          service providers. By giving Meetmemo access to any Third-Party
          Accounts, you agree to the following: (1) Meetmemo may access, make
          available, and store (if applicable) any content that you have
          provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account ("SNS Content") so
          that it is available on and through the Services via your Account,
          including, but not limited to, any friend lists; and (2) Meetmemo may
          send and receive additional information to your Third-Party Account to
          the extent you are no longer the account holder. Unless these Terms of
          Service say something different, all SNS content, if any, is
          considered to be User Content. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts
          you choose and the privacy settings you've made in those Third-Party
          Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your
          Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account on
          the Services. Please note that SNS Content may no longer be available
          on and through the Services if a Third-Party Account or an associated
          service becomes unavailable or if Meetmemo' access to a Third-Party
          Account is cut off by the third-party service provider. As explained
          below, you will be able to turn off the link between your Account on
          the Services and your Third-Party Accounts at any time. PLEASE NOTE
          THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH
          YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH
          SUCH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. Meetmemo doesn't try to check any SNS
          Content for accuracy, legality, or lack of infringement, among other
          things, and Meetmemo isn't responsible for any SNS Content.

        <p>
          PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND
          GOVERNS HOW YOU AND MEETMEMO CAN BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER. THIS
          SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND MEETMEMO TO
          SUBMIT CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON
          AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or
          relating to your use of the Services, you will contact us at
          support@Meetmemo.AI and you and Meetmemo will attempt in good faith to
          negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly. You agree that
          if the matter remains unresolved for 30 days after notification (via
          certified mail or personal delivery), such matter will be deemed a
          "Dispute" as defined below. Except for the right to seek injunctive or
          other equitable relief described under the "Binding Arbitration"
          section below, should you file any arbitration claims, or any
          administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to
          resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be
          entitled to recover attorneys' fees, even if you may have been
          entitled to them otherwise.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          You and Meetmemo agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
          out of or relating to this Agreement or to your use of the Services
          (collectively "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration,
          except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other
          equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the
          actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a
          party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
          intellectual property rights. This means that you and Meetmemo both
          agree to waive the right to a trial by jury. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, you may bring a claim against Meetmemo in "small claims"
          court, instead of by arbitration, but only if the claim is eligible
          under the rules of the small claims court and is brought in an
          individual, non-class, and non-representative basis, and only for so
          long as it remains in the small claims court and in an individual,
          non-class, and non-representative basis.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>
          You and Meetmemo agree that any proceedings to resolve Disputes will
          be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated,
          or representative action. This means that you and Meetmemo both agree
          to waive the right to participate as a plaintiff as a class member in
          any class action proceeding. Further, unless you and Meetmemo agree
          otherwise in writing, the arbitrator in any Dispute may not
          consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any
          form of class action proceeding.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Arbitration Administration and Rules</h3>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
          Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
          Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
          (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute
          Resolution' section. (The AAA Rules are available at
          http://www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Arbitration Process</h3>
        <p>
          A party who desires to initiate the arbitration must provide the other
          party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
          Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney
          licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be
          selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators with
          relevant experience. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
          arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the Demand for
          Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance
          with AAA Rules.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          Unless you and Meetmemo agree otherwise, the seat of the arbitration
          shall be in San Francisco, California. If your claim does not exceed
          USD$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis
          of documents you and Meetmemo submit to the arbitrator, unless you
          request a hearing and the arbitrator then determines that a hearing is
          necessary. If your claim exceeds USD$10,000, your right to a hearing
          will be determined by AAA Rules. Subject to AAA Rules, the arbitrator
          will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of
          information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of
          the arbitration. Hearings may be conducted by telephone or video
          conference, if requested and agreed to by the parties.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Arbitrator's Decision and Governing Law</h3>
        <p>
          The arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the Federal
          Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall
          honor claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator will
          render an award within the timeframe specified in the AAA Rules.
          Judgment on the arbitration may be entered in any court having
          jurisdiction thereof. Any award of damages by an arbitrator must be
          consistent with the "Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability" section
          above. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief in
          favor of the claimant only to the extent necessary to provide relief
          warranted by the claimant's individual claim.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium">Fees</h3>
        <p>
          Each party's responsibility to pay the arbitration filing,
          administrative and arbitrator fees will depend on the circumstances of
          the arbitration and are set forth in the AAA Rules.
